| Project name | Description | Libraries used | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| My 1st project: [Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting](1_st_project_preprocessing.ipynb) | The goals of the project were: 1) to train to prepare data for further analysis 2) to train to explore the data by finding relations between different values.  We were given a dataset containing information on borrowers' marital status, number of children, loan purposes and we were asked to analyse if there were an impact of such factors on  borrowers' default on a loan.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *nltk* |
| My 2nd project: [Car ads analysis](real_estate) | The goals of the project were: 1) to train EDA skills 2) to analyse how different factors (age, mileage, condition, transmission type, and color) impact on the vehicles' price.  We were given a dataset containing such information aggregated from an imaginery car ads platform named "Crankshaft List".| *pandas*, *numpy*, *nltk*, *matplotlib*|
| My 3rd project: [Telecommunications operator's plans analysis](real_estate) | The main goal of the project was to train performing tests of statistical significance. We were given datasets containing information on customers' "consumption" of calls, internet traffic and messages related to customers of imaginary telecommunications operator "Megaline". The operator had two plans and we were asked to analyse which of them bring in more revenue.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *nltk* , *matplotlib*, *scipy.stats*|
| My 4th project: [Games market trends analysis](real_estate) | The main goal of the project was to train skills gained in the previous projects. We were given dataset containing information on user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales. The operator had two plans and we were asked to analyse which of them bringed in more revenue.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *nltk* , *matplotlib*, *scipy.stats*, *seaborn*, *statsmodels*|
| My 5th project: [Chicago taxi market analysis](real_estate) | The main goal of the project was to train skills gained in the previous projects. We were given dataset containing information on user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales. The operator had two plans and we were asked to analyse which of them bringed in more revenue.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *nltk* , *matplotlib*, *scipy.stats*, *seaborn*, *statsmodels*|
| My 6th project: [Yandex.Afisha marketing expenses analysis](real_estate) | The main goal of the project was to train Business Analytics skills (such as cohort analysis). We were given datasets containing information users actitivity (visits and orders) as well as costs of their acquisition and we were asked to perform an analysis of efficiency of such expences.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*, *scipy.stats*, *seaborn*, *statsmodels*|
| My 7th project: [Making Business Decisions based on A/B tests](real_estate) | The main goal of the project was to train skills related to A/B test and hypothesis prioritising (RICE and ICE methods). We were given datasets containing raw data on A/B test results and we were asked to provide our conclusions.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *nltk* , *matplotlib*, *scipy.stats*, *seaborn*, *statsmodels*|
| My 8th project: [Restaurants market in Los Angeles](real_estate) | The main goal of the project was to train market trends research skills and story telling skills. We were given dataset containing information on restaurants establishments in Los Angeles and we were asked to study if it is a good idea to choose "café" sector to launch a new business - automated robotics cafes chain.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *plotly*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*|
| My 9th project: [Online grocery start-up users' behavior analysis](real_estate) | The main goal of the project was to train skills related to analysing events funnel and A/A/B tests. We were given a dataset containing information on users' actions performed when using the start-up app and the results of A/A/B test  and  we were asked to study users' behavior and analyse the results of the test.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *plotly*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*|
| My 10th project: [Model Fitness Gym clients churn analysis](real_estate) | The main goal of the project was to train skills related to using forecasts and predictions methods and customers clustering. We were given a dataset containing different information on customer of imaginary gym chain "Model Fitness Gym" and we were asked to perform customers clustering as well as to suggest a model predicting customers' churn.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *plotly*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *sklearn*, *scipy*|
| My 11th project: [Telecom: Identifying Ineffective Operators](real_estate) | The main goal of the project was to train "task decomposition" skills and apply the whole range skills gained during the training programm. We were given a dataset aggregated by calls distribution service provider containing information on call agents performance and we were asked to define which agents may be considered as ineffective and then compare two groups of agents.| *pandas*, *numpy*, *plotly*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *sklearn*, *scipy*, *missingno*, *re*, *math*, *datetime*|
