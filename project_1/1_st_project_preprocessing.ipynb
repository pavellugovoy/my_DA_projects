    "We see that the number of rows with missing values in the column 'days_employed' and 'total_income' is 2174, and these are the same rows. So, probably, these are the customers which just have not provided information on their employment conditions (income level and employment period).  Such rows make 10% of all rows, so it is quite significant, so we need to keep them if it is possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.1. missing values in 'days_employed'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to we describe() method and other methods we have applied to the values of this column are strange: the mean of all values is  63046 days, i.e. 172 years.  It is not just possibe in real world. At the same time we've found out that there are many negative values. So if replace them with positive ones, the mean will be more higher. We don't know the reason, but this data is either very damaged or represents some other information (not employment period). It's not possible to restore it without having additional information. As we do not need it for our research we may just leave it \"as is\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2. missing values in \"total_income\". \n",
    "Unlike the employment period data on customers' total income is important for us, because we will use it in our research. So we need to fill in them with average/median values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at \"income_type\" column we see that there are different types of income. Among them there are \"retiree\", \"business\", \"employee\", \"civil servant\". The customers of these categories may have  different average/median income. As there is no significant outliers in these groups which have impact on the whole picture, we use mean value to fill in the missing values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. missing values in 'children'\n",
    "\n",
    "If we count the values in the \"children\" column we find that there are strange values: 76 customers with 20 children and 47 customers with a negative number of children. 20 children in a family is a rare case.  Within the customers of the bank, for example, there are only 9 customers with 5 children and 41 with with 4. So this information is most probably false, and it is probably a result of a typo, and it should be \"2\" instead of \"20\". Taking into account that the number of the rows with missing values is not signifacnt compare to the total number of customers, so if we make a mistake it will not affect dramaticcaly the data if we change the value of these rows to \"2\" - the most \"probable\" number in this case. The same logic goes with the negative number: it is oubviously false, it is a typo. The number of inccorect values is not significant, so we may change this  value for \"1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. missing values in 'dob_years'\n",
    "\n",
    "In the column 'dob_years' there are 101 rows with zero values. It means that there are 101 customers information on the age thereof is misssing, because among the customers of the bank there is no kid. Normally we woud fill in these missing values with the median/mean values for each type of the customers (we can find out of this type from the column 'income_type'), but as this data is not necessary for our analysis, we may leave this data unchanged.

We've used str.lower() to equalize the values of this column.  After that we've found 71 duplicated rows. So that means that these rows are filled with exactly the same data including 'total_income', 'dob_years', 'days_employed', 'purpose' and other columns. It may be caused by human error: an operator when non-intentially copied these rows two or more times extracting them 'by hand' from one data base to another. These rows relate to the same customers and therefore we cannot and we should not merge them to keep some data calculated. Such duplicates make data dirtier (we would analyse the same cases as different), so we need to drop them out. We have dropped them out using drop_duplicates().    "

    "Among the values we need to anylise we have two columns with a vast list of values: the first contains information of customers' income ('total_income') and the other one contains information on the loan purpose ('purpose'). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The values of the total_income column are that different for \"natural\" reasons: different people have different income, so that's why there is so wide range. \n",
    "\n",
    "But it is not very convinient to analyse such data: we need to compare many values, so we need some categorization of these values.  We'have divided these values into 6 groups according to the following rules: \n",
    "- the group with the lowest income is the group of customers with the income lower than rest 95% of others, \n",
    "- the the group with low income is the group of those having income higher than than the lowset income group but lower than  rest 80% of others,\n",
    "- the group with low middle income is the group of those having income higher than than the low income group but lower than  rest 50% of others,\n",
    "- the group with middle income is the group of those having income higher than than the low middle income group but lower than rest 20% of others,\n",
    "- the group with high income is the group of those having income higher than middle income group ibut lower than the rest 5% of others,\n",
    "- the group with upper high income is the group of those having income higher than high income group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we have used quantile() method to determine the milestones and we have written a function returning names of each category. We have put new values to  a new column \"income_group'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The values of purpose group may differ for several reasons. Maybe, it is explained by the content of questionaires customers fill in when they get a loan (ther are many options to choose). But due to the \"style\" of the definitions used to describe the purpose the most probable reason is that  customers define the purpose on their own, so they write what they wish and the definitions vary, this is \"natural\". We have divided the purposes of loan into 4 groups: wedding needs, real estate needs, car purchase needs, and education needs.  To do this we have first looked at values, then with SnowballStemmer method we have defined the relevant \"stemms\" for key words describing the said reasons. And finally we have written a function returning names to fill in the values a new column with the said grouped purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a column with values relating to marital status ('family_status'). These values are also very clos to each other ('divorced' is close to 'unmarried' and \"widow/widower\", as they are all single). But in fact they materially differ, because the legal status and civil rights and obligations of each of the type vary, so it may have impact on their loan payment discipline. That's why we decided to leave these data \"as is\" "

    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis was to determine if a customer’s marital status, number of children, income level, loan purposes have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform this analysis we used data on customers’ credit worthiness regarding previous period. We assume that  if nothing is materially changed in human behavior due to economic and/or legal environment the conclusions we made based on this analysis may be used for future customers' banking scoring purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains the following information regarding each of the customers: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. number of customer's children;\n",
    "2. number of days of customer's employment period;\n",
    "3. customer's education; \n",
    "4. customer's marital status;\n",
    "5. customer's gender;\n",
    "6. customer's age;\n",
    "7. customer's income type;\n",
    "8. customer's debt default; \n",
    "9. customer's income; \n",
    "10. purpose of customer's loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "We preanalysed the data and found out that there were several issues with the values of the data and the some data need to be preprocessed before the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "II. PREPROCESSING \n",
    "\n",
    "A. Missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "We discovered missing values in the columns of the table related to the information on number of customer's children, number of days of customer's employment period, customer's age, customer's income. Here is the way how we processed these missing values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Missing values in information on related to number of days of customer's employment period and customer's income. \n",
    "The number of rows with missing values in the columns 'days_employed' (employment period) and 'total_income' (customer's income) is 2174, and these are the same rows. So, probably, these are the customers which just have not provided information on their employment conditions (income level and employment period).  Such rows make 10% of all rows, so it is quite significant, so normally we need to keep them if it is possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.1. Missing values in 'days_employed'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to describe() method and other methods we applied to the values of this columnm we found out that these values were strange: the mean of all values is  63046 days, i.e. 172 years.  It is not just possibe in real world. At the same time we found out that there were many negative values. So if we had replaced them with positive ones, the mean would have been more higher. We don't know the reason, but this data is either very damaged or represents some other information (not employment period). It was not possible to restore them without having additional information. As we did not need it for our research we decided to leave these values \"as is\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2. Missing values in \"total_income\". \n",
    "Unlike the employment period information on customers' total income is important for us, because we further used it in our research. \n",
    "The question was which value or values to choose to fill in these one. We assumed that the customers with different income type ('retiree', 'emlpoyee', 'business' and so on) had different average and median income level. Hence we analysed income level of customers divided into different categories. We found that there were no significant outliers in these groups and we decided therefore to fill the missing values with a average value belonging to the relevant income type category.  \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Missing values in 'children'.\n",
    "\n",
    "We some strange values in the information related to the information on the quantity of customer's children: 76 customers with 20 children and 47 customers with a negative number of children. 20 children in a family is a rare case.  Within the customers of the bank, for example, there were only 9 customers with 5 children and 41 with with 4. So this information is most probably false, and it is probably a result of a typo, and it should be \"2\" instead of \"20\". Taking into account that the number of the rows with missing values was not signifacnt compare to the total number of customers, so if we had made a mistake it would not have affected dramaticcaly the data. Hence  we changed the value of these rows to \"2\" - the most probable\" number in this case. The same logic we applied to the  the negative number: it was oubviously false, it was a typo. The number of inccorect values was not significant, so we changed this value to \"1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Missing values in 'dob_years'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the column 'dob_years' there were 101 rows with zero values. It means that there were 101 customers information on the age thereof was misssing, because among the customers of the bank there was no kid. Normally we woud have filled in these missing values with the median/mean values for each type of the customers (as we did with the missing values on the income level), but as this data was not necessary for our analysis, we left this data unchanged.  \n",
    "\n",
    "B. Changing data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "The column 'total_income' (customer's income) and 'dob_years' (age) contained the values of float type. We don't need the age information for our analysism, so we didn't change it. For our research the float type for values of customers' income was excessive, as we did not need to know every cent to make a conclusion, while the short numbers look easier and better. Hence we changed the data type of these values from float to integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Processing duplicates. \n",
    "\n",
    "We found initially 54 duplicates. But the values in the column 'education' were written differently but had the same meaning. This had impact on the number of detected duplicated values. After we equalized the values of this column we found 71 duplicated rows. So that means that these rows are filled with exactly the same data including 'total_income', 'dob_years', 'days_employed', 'purpose' and other columns. It might be caused by human error: an operator non-intentially copied these rows two or more times extracting them 'by hand' from one data base to another. These rows relate to the same customers and therefore we could not and we should not merge them to keep some data calculated. Such duplicates would have made data dirtier (we would have analysed the same cases as different), so we dropped them out using drop_duplicates() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "D. Categorizing Data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the values we need to anylize we had two columns with a vast list of values: the first related to the information of customers' income ('total_income') and the other to the information on the loan purpose ('purpose'). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer's income. \n",
    "The values of the total_income column are that different for \"natural\" reasons: different people have different income, so that's why there is so wide range. \n",
    "\n",
    "But it is not very convinient to analyse such data: we need to compare many values, so we need some categorization of these values.  We divided these values into 6 groups according to the following rules: \n",
    "- the group with the lowest income is the group of customers with the income lower than rest 95% of others, \n",
    "- the the group with low income is the group of those having income higher than than the lowset income group but lower than  rest 80% of others,\n",
    "- the group with low middle income is the group of those having income higher than than the low income group but lower than  rest 50% of others,\n",
    "- the group with middle income is the group of those having income higher than than the low middle income group but lower than rest 20% of others,\n",
    "- the group with high income is the group of those having income higher than middle income group ibut lower than the rest 5% of others,\n",
    "- the group with upper high income is the group of those having income higher than high income group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we have used quantile() method to determine the milestones and we have written a function returning names of each category. We have put new values to  a new column \"income_group'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Purpose category. \n",
    "The values of 'purpose' might differ for several reasons. It may be explained by the content of questionaires customers fill in when they get a loan (ther are many options to choose). But due to the \"style\" of the definitions used to describe the purpose the most probable reason is that  customers define the purpose on their own, so they write what they wish and the definitions vary, this is \"natural\". We have divided the purposes of loan into 4 groups: \n",
    "- wedding needs, \n",
    "- real estate needs, \n",
    "- car purchase needs, and \n",
    "- education needs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we first looked at values, then with SnowballStemmer method we  defined the relevant \"stemms\" for key words describing the said reasons. And finally we wrote a function returning names to fill in the values a new column with the said grouped purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a column with values relating to marital status ('family_status'). These values are also very close to each other ('divorced' is close to 'unmarried' and \"widow/widower\", as they are all single). But in fact they materially differ, because the legal status and civil rights and obligations of each of the type vary, so it may have impact on their loan payment discipline. That's why we decided to leave these data \"as is\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "III. RESEARCH \n",
    "\n",
    "A. Having kids and paying loan in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We found the ratio of customers having kids having defaulted to all customers having kids ('Having kids default ratio') and the same value for those non-having kids ('Non-having kids default ratio'). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the results: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Having kids default ratio is 0,92\n",
    "2. Non-having kids default ratio is 0,75\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that those who have no kids were more reliable than those having kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time we found an exception to this rule: all of  9 customers with 5 children have never defaulted the payments. \n",
    "\n",
    "B. Marital status and payment default.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have calculated for each marital status group ratio of number of customers having defaulted to all customers of grop and have found that unmarried persons and customers being in civil partnership defaulted more than others, widows and widowers defaulted the less, and the middle of the statistics are married and divorced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the exact ratios found in descending order: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. unmarried         0.097509\n",
    "2. civilpartnership  0.093471\n",
    "3. married           0.075452 \n",
    "4. divorced          0.071130\n",
    "5. widow / widower   0.065693\n",
    "                   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Income level and payment default. \n",
    "\n",
    "We calculated for each income group ratio of number of customers having defaulted to all customers of such a group and found that the best borrowers were customers with lowest income level! That was a little surprise. At the second place are the customers with high and upper high income with similar default ratio as the lowest income customers. Middle income customers paid worse, low income customers paid a little bit worse than middle income level customers but better than low_middle_income customers which paid the worst. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the exact ratio numbers in descending order: \n",
    "                \n",
    "1. low middle income     0.086700\n",
    "2. low income            0.084835\n",
    "3. middle income         0.083748\n",
    "4. high income           0.069919\n",
    "5. upper high_income     0.069897\n",
    "6. lowest income         0.066170\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Loan purposes and payment default.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculated for each loan purpose customers group the ratio of customers having defaulted to all customers of the group.  We  found that the worst clients were those who took loans for car purchase needs. They are followed by those who took loans for education. The customers who borrowed money for wedding purpose were a little bit better than the first three, but the best customers were those who took loans for real estate needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the exact results: \n",
    "           \n",
    "1. car               0.093590\n",
    "2. education         0.092200\n",
    "3. wedding           0.080034\n",
    "4. real_estate       0.072334\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "IV. ADDITIONAL REMARKS \n",
    "\n",
    "The results we found may be used to evaluate the client reliability. But we always should take into account that along with the general line there is a place for an \"exception\". We see it, for example, in the case of customers with kids and without kids, and the case of lowest income borrowers, which are were the best clients, while low income clients perform their payments worse than those who earn more. \n",
