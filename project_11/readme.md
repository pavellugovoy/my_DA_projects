**Description:**\
The main goal of the project was to train "task decomposition" skills and apply the whole range skills gained during the training programm. We were given a dataset aggregated by calls distribution service provider containing information on call agents performance and we were asked to define which agents may be considered as ineffective and then compare two groups of agents.\
